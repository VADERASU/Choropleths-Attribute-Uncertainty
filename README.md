# Exploring the Sensitivity of Choropleths under Attribute Uncertainty


## Getting Started

These code is for IEEE TVCG paper 'Exploring the Sensitivity of Choropleths under Attribute Uncertainty'

Node version: 10.10.0 (important)

Npm version: 6.4.1 (important)

## Installing
to develop with full live reload. use:
```
npm install
npm start 
```

Open Chrome and run the system at "localhost:8000"

## Case study
To obtain the results we presented in the paper, please follow Video.mp4.

Every case need to load the data by using the top-right button ‘File’ in the system.

### Interface

To arrive to the state shown at video 00:31 by loading the ‘Crime Data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button.

To arrive to the state shown at video 00:59 by loading the ‘Election data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button. Then, the user should select ‘EDU635213’ and ‘EDU685213’, set the groups number as ‘5’, and click the ‘Run K-means’ button to run the clustering algorithm.

To arrive to the state shown at video 01:10 by loading the ‘Crime Data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button. Then, the user should select ‘ROBBERY’, set the groups number as ‘6’, and click the ‘Run K-means’ button to run the clustering algorithm.

### Interface (Video 01:27)

To arrive to the state shown at video 01:27 by loading the ‘Crime Data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button.

### Interface (Video 03:00)

To arrive to the state shown at video 03:00 by loading the ‘Election Data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button.

### Interface (Video 05:15)

To arrive to the state shown at video 05:15 by loading the ‘Election Data’ and clicking the ‘Cluster Parameters’ button.

##Data

The Crime data (CommAreasNew.zip, Ccrimeeventdata.txt) and the election data (tl_2017_us_county.zip, election.zip) are now available at https://github.com/VADERASU/Choropleths-Attribute-Uncertainty/tree/master/data.

We use the open sources dataset.

The Crime data are downloaded at:
[Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2015/vwwp-7yr9) 

The Election data are downloaded at:
[USA Census Data](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//county_election_2012_2016-variables/)
